BAMAZON is a Node.js-based, real-time store and check-out system using the MySQL local host database.

Please check out the tutorial __video__ [right here!](https://github.com/Tinedanzer/bamazon/blob/master/README.md]

1)   In order for this to work for you, you will have to create your own localhost, MySQL server.

2) From there, just simply replace 'port,user,password'  into the matching spots in the function sqlObj(arg) object!

3)Run the sql code in MySql workbench, then run the javascript file in your node consule and enjoy the magic!

ex: node .\bamazonCustomer.js
