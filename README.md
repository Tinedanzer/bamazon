BAMAZON is a Node.js-based, real-time store/check-out system using the MySQL local host database.

Please check out the tutorial video here !

In order for this to work for you, you will have to create your own localhost, MySQL server.

From there, just simply replace 'port,user,password'  into the function sqlObj(arg) object!

Run the sql code in MySql, then run the javascript file in your node consule and enjoy the magic!
ex: node .\bamazonCustomer.js
